Trail shoe equivalent of bondis…,"I’ve been using bondis for a few years now in 2E size which are great for my hallux rigidus. I use one pair for day to day and another pair for running. Mainly dry trails and canal paths but for wet muddy trail runs they have no grip (no surprise!)

I tried the speed goats which had excellent grip in the mud but after each run my knee hurt, they definitely didn’t feel as cushioned so I think this was causing my knee pain. 

I think my only other options are the challenger  and the Stinson but it looks like the challenger isn’t as plush or supported as the bondi and the Stinson is a stable shoe and the bondi is a neutral shoe so may cause me issues?

I was wondering if anyone else had similar dilemma as me and what the eventually settled on? A shame there is no bondi trail version as that would be perfect!",1.0,1737928490.0,1,"Stinson will be best, try nike zegama and asics trabuco max"

New Hokas Don't Feel Right,"I need some help.

I have AWFUL plantar faciitis and I went a couple of years barely being able to walk until my podiatrist told me to get some HOKAS. I got the Bondi 8 in wide and they have been life changing! My feet don't hurt anymore, I can move faster, and everything has been all around better. 

My only issue is that they are not waterproof and I can't find anything that is that has the same support. So now it's time to replace them and I researched all of HOKA shoes and found the Transport Chukka GTX had waterproof options and looked like what I was looking for. So I ordered a pair from HOKA. I like that they have a Fly for 30 program so I can try them out for 30 days and return them if they don't work.

Well I've given them a week and I just don't know. They don't feel like they have the same arch support and even though they did not have the wide option ( I ordered an 8 again) they feel loose. I'm also not a fan of the elastic shoe strings. They came with regular laces but I can't figure out how to remove the elastic ones without cutting them entirely. I usually wear a 7.5 but because my foot is wide I will size up for a better fit. 

I am considering sending them back and just getting a Bondi 9 but they still don't have those in waterproof. The Bondi SR has a water resistant option, but I'm not sure how they compare to the Bondi 8 or 9.

So 1. Does anyone know how to remove the stretchy laces without cutting them

And 2. Does anyone have a lot of experience with HOKAS that can help me figure out if I am just getting the wrong style? I do have a high arch and I am very overweight so the extra cushion in the Bondis has been phenomenal. I do not wear orthotics. 

TIA",0.67,1737845836.0,1,"Bondi SR is a great option. I used them through nursing clinicals and I would have not gotten through with another shoe. 

I can’t wear the transports because they do not have the same support and not as comfortable as the Bondi and Clifton. 

1. The only way to remove the laces is by cutting them. I recommend putting some painters tape on beforehand so they do not fray. 

2. Been working at a retail store and have some experience but not an expert."
Are my hokas men's or women's,"I am a woman with really wide feet and it's not uncommon for me to buy men's shoes.

Odd feet,"A while back I had an accident and broke my calcaneous - I strongly do not recommend!!! 

My left foot is likely always going to have some issues from now on. One of the issues is that it's overpronated even when just standing, to the point that I need to wear an orthotic or I end up with blistering on my arch from friction.

What I'm wondering is whether people think it's worth me buying shoes for overpronation when only one foot needs this support (the other 'healthy' foot is neutral or possibly even underpronated), or choosing something in between and using orthotics?

I don't live anywhere near any stockists so unfortunately I can't try shoes before I buy.

Any input or guidance would be much appreciated!",1.0,1737674797.0,3,"I have industry experience. I would say if one foot overpronates and the other foot borderline underpronates (otherwise known as supination), I would stick with a neutral shoe with orthotics. Especially if the overpronation is severe on the one foot, orthotics will likely give that foot better support than the support built into stability shoes.

Luckily, Hoka is a very orthotic-friendly brand! They have a more natural foot shape than most brands (the other one to try for this is Altra), so they accommodate orthotics very well. I would try the Clifton 9, Skyflow, or Bondi 9. All three of these shoes have wide versions available if you need it.

I hope this helps!"
Are GTX worth it?,Completely subjective question but I am wondering if the GTX is worth it for running in the weather versus my normal Clifton 9’s. ,1.0,1737669063.0,4,"Gtx is good for keeping your foot warm and dry from the outside elements.

Bondi 9 came out 5 days ago so I thought I would try to help other people that don't have retail locations that stock 'wide' to try on. The width difference is enormous.

Which one is the best Allrounder? ,"Hey together,

I am looking for an Allrounder, which I can wear in like Columbia for a whole month for hiking, running and city trips. I only want to bring one pair of shoes and maybe a pair of flip flips with me.

So far I have tried the Arahi, Mach 6 and speedgoat 6 and I wear them all in the ""wide"" version.

As i want some shoes I can wear with every weather condition I am looking for some gore tex. 

And with wide and gore tex the only options from hoka are the speedgoat 6 and the anacapa 2. 

Do you have an opinion, which shoe would fit my needs the best? I want to do a lot of road and trail running during my vacation and the anacapa seems to be more for hiking, but I don't know why it shouldn't be good for running?

Opinions?  I Wear Bondi 8 in wide - looking for similar Hoka with GTX?,"I have a pair of Bondi 8s in wide/2E that I love. I don't normally wear wide but when I tried them on the regulars were tight near the ball of my foot and the 2E seemed to solve the problem. I've had them for about a year, wear them mostly for work and I'd honestly say they are the best shoe I've ever worn.

I'd love to get something similar that is more waterproof or GTX like the Clifton's or maybe even a Kaha 2 or 3. Neither of these come in wides so I'm curious if anyone has been in a similar situation? The Transport GTX comes in wide but I'm not a fan of the all black colorway. I'm also tempted by the Bondi SR but I'm not a huge fan of the style/colors. Almost bought the green in wide but it sold old.

How to stop my ankle from being stabbed every step?,"I have the Challenger 7 and only my right foot gets stabbed in my ankle with every step. I've tried tightening it, leaving it lose, no luck there.

I also remember there being a bright orange and blue that also doesn't exist in the new lineup. They don't even have the gray to white gradient soles like my old pair. just a black shoe with a plain white sole. The gradient was what elevated a pretty basic looking shoe.

I would rather not risk trying a different shoe style but I don't want to buy a boring shoe :(",1.0,1737156639.0,3,"It's all sales based, unfortunately. They make less of the bright colors and more neutrals (especially in wide) because that's what's selling. I've definitely seen this at the running store I work at. There's also been an uptick in recent years of people wanting Hoka and similar brands for things other than running, such as for every day wear or work. As the need for that sort of purpose increases, the colors get more boring because most people don't want to wear bright shoes for those purposes.

Bondi 9 - First Run/ Impressions!,"Bought the new HOKA Bondi 9’s from the Covent Garden store today and took them for a spin, here’s my thoughts!

First about me, a 30-something causal runner and run to offset the booze! 

- Try run between 50-100k per month 
- Pace around 6’00” + 
- A few injuries developed overtime so the days of speed are over 
- Most recently suffering from plantar fasciitis in my left foot, which means shoe consideration is quite important 
- Over-pronate on the left side as well 
- Have custom in-soles after seeing a podiatrist 
- Podiatrist advised can still run in neutral trainers 

Shoes I have tried over the past few years (for comparison):
- NB 1080v13: loved them but in the end too squishy and the plantar heal pain worsened 
- NB More v5: Recently tried but are massive. Love the squish but again too much I think 
- HOKA Mach 5: Liked this but support was not good and a likely cause of my plantar 
- HOKA Clifton 9: Loved the thought of getting on with them but couldn’t. Felt like i was running in sand 
- HOKA Bondi 8: again wanted to like them but were too big and firm for a ‘cushioned’ shoe
- ON Monsters: Tried a few runs in them but for a shoe to claim it’s like walking on clouds and it’s like running with planks of wood on your feet, is quite ironic m
- Brooks Adrenaline 23: Thought would be good for plantar but way too firm for me. 
- Brooks Ghost Max: Tried, couldn’t get on with them 
 ASICS Novablast 3: At first liked them but didn’t quite fit right 
- Puma Mag Max: my other shoe in rotation at the moment and can’t complain about it. Well the only fault is the heel collar collapsed when putting one shoe on, which was annoying 

Have tried various Nike pegs and too firm.

Anyway did a 5K in these tonight and first impressions were pretty good!

- TTS: purchased in UK10 (wide) 
- UK10/10.5 in normal fitting were too big/ small so I’d advise going for the wider fit 
- Run was smooth, transitions felt nice, rocker was good for my feet. 
- Not the most exiting ride or bounce like with the NB cushion 
- Better than the Bondi 8 and don’t feel like a brick 
- Style/ colour way looks good 

The only thing to note, and I don’t know if it’s just me but my big toe does feel like it rubbed up against the upper quite a bit, in a way that may blister over time. But hopefully as I wear them in this should begin to wear better.

Overall happy with them and seems like a good upgrade to me (that said it’s early days and after a measly 5K post work run!) ",1.0,1736976686.0,21,Bruv…you’re not a casual runner…you seem very much more than casual. Great info! I’m Clifton 9 fan right now. Love for both walk and run.

Hoka Kaha 2 wetting out,,1.0,1737022478.0,1,"G'day all, I recently replaced my boots with the Hoka Kaha 2's. I really like them, they're comfortable and didn't need any breaking in. I've only walked in them a couple of times but on my last \~20k hike over snow covered ground they wetted out and had cold spots. As you can see from the photos they took nearly 3 days to dry as they were soaked through.

Just wondering if this is an issue with the factory DWR coating or if it's normal and something I'll just have to live with. I can return them but they were bought online so I'll be without boots while they sort it out and they could potentially say it's normal.

Photos are after 24 hours and 48 hours. Thanks and appreciate any advice 👍🏻"

Clifton 10 - why the heel drop of 8mm and different last?,"Sounds like it is official with first reviewers having hands on the new Clifton 10 and the specs.

I suffer from Hallux Rigidus and the current Clifton 9 GTX (stiff shoe and a mild drop of just 5mm) combined with Hallux trainer insoles have been amazing.

Unethical to have a window for returns and no functional way to return them. ,"The HOKA returns center has been down for at least a week.

Warranty Department is a joke,"After calling Hoka for the third time, I finally received an update on my warranty return. Hoka had my shoes for almost a month and I had heard nothing from them during that time. Each time I received an update it was because I called and the only information I received was ""they have it and they will reach out"". I had owned my Bondi 8's for no more then 8 months before the fabric began to separate from the sole. It is very clear that it is not a tear or rip and that the glue used to bond the fabric to the sole had failed. 

  
To rub salt in the wound, Hoka has chosen to make it impossible for customers to speak and or dispute claims with the warranty department. Their own employees and management can not either. Talk about terrible and shady business practices. 

Paying 165.00 for a pair of shoes and to have them fail within a year and then be denied is absurd. It's mind boggling seeing all these paid ads and influencers touting the brand only to finally see them for what they are.

Its a shame, I REALLY liked the Bondi 8's. Very comfortable and helped with my foot pain. It's sad that after being treated this way I wont be buying another pair. I hope that my experience can shed some light on the other side of Hoka and what one can expect from them.",0.5,1736798205.0,0,"Really surprised to hear about this...i would have thought they'd be GREAT !!!

Hoka NZ live chat service is very poor!,"It’s my first time to order a pair of Bondi 8 shoes from Hoka NZ website and I ordered it on 22/12/2024, just before Christmas break and didn’t have much hopes to receive it before the busy holiday season came. Then I received a confirmation email on 27/12/2024 along with a tracking number. I was hoping fingers crossed 🤞 that I would receive it when I returned from holiday. The shipment status was shown as “allocated ready” and then there were no updates ever since 27/12/2024. 

I decided to contact their customer service and was hoping to hear any updates on 13/01/2025, but unfortunately there was NO luck at all.

Bondi 9 vs. Clifton 10 vs. Skyflow: Need advice for my next pair!,"**Hi fellow runners,**

It’s time to retire my Bondi 8s, and I’m considering what to get next. Since the Bondi 9 and Clifton 10 are coming out soon, I’m torn between the two.

The Bondi 9 seems like the natural choice since I’ve loved the Bondi 8, but I’m also tempted by the Clifton 10. At 55 years old and weighing 94kg (207 lbs), I’m thinking the lighter Clifton might be a good option—especially now that it also has an 8mm drop, which I’ve heard could make things easier on my feet.

Although I don't need a stability shoe, the wide base of the Bondis provides some stability, which works well for me, and I’m not sure if the Clifton will offer the same.

While browsing, I stumbled upon a model I wasn’t familiar with: the *Skyflow*. Does anyone here have experience with them? How do they compare to the Bondi or Clifton? I’m hesitant to take a risk since where I live, there’s no option to exchange or try before buying.

Coming from the Bondi 8, would it be best to stick with the Bondi 9, or should I try the Clifton 10—or even give the Skyflow a shot? I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences to help me decide.

Thanks in advance, and happy running! 🏃‍♂️",1.0,1736698719.0,7,I had to send my skyflows back - I felt they were so heavy. Love my Clifton 9s - weigh nothing at all

Hoka Transport - Ball Foot Pain,"Review of Hoka Transport (Regular, Non-Goretex) After a 2-Month Asia Trip

Fit: I sized up for my pair of Hoka Transport, opting for the regular version instead of the Goretex model.

Overall Performance:
	•	Comfort: These shoes provided solid comfort and support throughout my trip.
	•	Support: The ankle and midsole support were excellent, with sufficient bounce to keep me energized during long walks.
	•	Protection: The design was protective enough to prevent back pain, which is often an issue for me during extended wear.

Challenges:
While my left foot felt fine, my right foot developed severe pain in the ball of the foot, near the area adjacent to the second toe. Unfortunately, this pain has persisted even a month after I stopped wearing the Hokas. It’s called Metatarsalgia

Solutions Tried:
	•	Switching to thick wool or cotton socks helped alleviate some of the discomfort in my right foot.
	•	Alternating with a different pair of sneakers also made a noticeable difference.

Pain is called Metatarsalgia defined as: (met-uh-tahr-SAL-juh) is a condition in which the ball of your foot becomes painful and inflamed. You might develop it if you participate in activities that involve running and jumping. There are other causes as well, including foot deformities and shoes that are too tight or too loose.rr",1.0,1736640999.0,2,"Mine hurt my feet in that spot too too. I’m quickly fatigued wearing them.

Anyway, just before I started my run today, a piece of the outer sole just...broke off the shoe!

Warranty ,"About 4 months ago I came on this sub and asked about an issue with my shoes tread. I was encouraged to file a warranty claim. I was hesitant since I'd read here and elsewhere that the warranty is typically denied as ""Normal Wear and Tear"". After I noticed the tread separating I quit wearing the shoes and wore a pair of Brooks Ghosts that I own. It took me a few months to send my shoes off because life happened. 

On December 18th, I finally shipped my shoes off with all the paperwork that Hoka requested, as well as a note explaining that the shoes were only worn for 2 months and hadn't been worn since the tread started to separate. On December 28th I got an email from Hoka letting me know that my order was assessed and I received store credit. It is now January 2nd, and my new shoes just arrived!

Clifton 9 GTX or transport GTX for a water resistant travel shoe,"I’m looking for a water resistant shoe that is good for daily walking a lot when I travel.

Right now I’m looking at the Clifton 9 GTX or transport GTX. From what I’ve found the Clifton is better. I had a chance to try on the Clifton and it was fine. I also tried on the on cloud waterproof, way too tight of a fit.

It’s mainly city walking with the occasional non-serious trail if I come across something.

I do care about durability. I vacation 2-3 times a year and usually city walk around 8 miles a day. I only like to have one pair of shoe when I travel.

Other than hoka, I’m open to other suggestions. Things that matter:

-	Breathable (as much as possible with water resistant shoes)
-	Durable
-	Comfy for walking from morning to night all over a city
-	Black or black and white
-	Shoes, not boots. Shoes that can go with anything
-	No more than $200",1.0,1735838078.0,3,GTX won't be breathable. If you like the Clinton's get those. Or whatever comes in a cooler color. If you'll be walking them in either will do.
Best model for flat feet ,"Hello folks!

I have been running in Clifton 9 for over two years (runner from 10y) and preferred Hoka over Brooks, Adidas etc. I recently found out that I have flat feet (I know it’s weird at 36). I am 162 cm for 51 kg, which Hoka would you recommend? 

I tried in shop ASICS GT and Saucony Guide but the support felt painful! I would not like to abandon Hoka :(

"Clifton 9, knee pain even after 2 months of wearing","I’ve been a long time vans and converse wearer, never thought too much about shoes because I didnt walk more than 1 hour without break.

My lifestyle changed and I’m walking at least 1.5 hours now - not often, but every 3 days or so. On other days, I’m working from home and would do house chores on my feet.

All to say, the tougher soles and cramped toe box of my old shoes gave me the motivation to buy a pair of Clifton 9. I’ve not worn a pair of sport shoes for almost 10 years until this one. Loved it. But after these long walks, its inevitable that my left knee will feel very tender when bending and straightening. I thought maybe its just because I need time to get used to them, it has been a little over 2 months now and I’m still getting this.

From what I can find, this is likely called runner’s knee or IT band syndrome. I’m hoping some of these exercises suggested online would help, otherwise I might need to shelf them and go back to converse.

If anyone experienced or experiencing this similar feeling, please share how youre dealing with it.",0.67,1735810983.0,1,I would go to a local running store and get fitted for a proper shoe even if not wearing as a runner.

Whenever I get a new pair of runners I usually have less than 40miles before they are fully broken in humming along.

Bondi SR for Outdoor Work,"I work maintenance for an apartment complex, and I have been wearing the same pair of Bondi X for 3 years. Started out in Texas, and for the last year I've been in high desert central Oregon. They've got holes and wear, the yellow has darkened, and the soles are nearly exposing the carbon fiber plate because I ran across hot coals a couple months back (the fact they're still going is a testament to their quality).

I just ordered another pair from Nordstrom Rack, but as it's discontinued in favor of the Skyward X I may not have that option again after another year. I have issues with my toes, and the only shoe that has ever been comfortable has been the Bondi X. But now I'm hoping to venture into something longer lasting on a professional level, more suited to wet conditions, and safer for stairs. The tail on the bondi X takes a special kind of awareness that eventually becomes second nature, but it's still easy to clip your heel and pull the sole away from the shoe working on stairwells, and can be dangerous when carrying heavy loads.

I also picked up a pair of Kaha 2 GTX boots for the upcoming snow season, and hope for those to last me into summer hikes at the river and some creeks. So I don't have to worry about trying to fit my cleats over the long Bondi X, or even the SR.

But I have a few questions about the SR. Generally, how do the Bondi SR kicks perform in an outdoor, mostly concrete, some dirt/crushed rock environment? What about a rainy outdoor environment? How long do they typically last, compared to your average Hoka runners? Finally, would you even recommend them for outdoor work?",0.75,1735642122.0,2,"They're good shoes. Idk what else to tell you.

Even if you could find it, for a 13, it would probably be something like $600-700. The biggest discount you could possibly get would be like to $500. And if you’re buying used anything below $400 would be absolutely cooked.

New Hokas are not comfortable,"I got my Gaviota 5 Hokas a couple weeks ago. When I first put them on, they felt so comfortable. I wore them out of the store and went shopping for an hour. It was painful. I went back to the store and got some insoles that barely helped. It was ridiculous to spend almost $200 on shoes and still need to buy inserts. I had immediate regret. I got them for a trip where I would be walking a lot, so I wore them the first two days. My feet were killing me, so I put my $40 Sketchers on for the rest of the trip. My feet immediately stopped hurting. These shoes are not worth the cost, and I'm embarrassed because I spent so much on them. It makes you want to tell people they're comfortable when they ask so you don't look so stupid for spending so much money on utter trash.",0.6,1734315030.0,2,Hokas go through a cycle: in-store; they’re amazing > wear them a little more and they hurt > next time they kind of are not as comfortable as you remember the first time (x3) > suddenly a week or so later they’re perfect for your feet. Unlike other brands these really do break in.
Selling Hoka Bondi 8 'Ether Illusion' Size 6 Womens ,"I bought these for my gf for the holidays but realized I should get her a better running shoe for her instead. These were a seasonal colorway and are no longer available online on Hoka.

I bought these off Goat, so I can't return them in-store for credit, but I can verify anything if you would like me to. 

I'm just looking to get these sold soon so I can have enough time to buy her a new pair of shoes before Christmas! DM for any questions or inquiries. happy holidays 🎄

Need help choosing a pair of Hokas,"Hi guys and gals,
Advice needed on what shoes would be the best for me & how Hokas define themselves.
I don't need anything overly specialized, just a pair of shoes to walk around in, endgoal: Disneyland, etc. For now, I am mainly just doing chores around the house & short, occasional shopping trips.
I am recovering from a couple broken feet and ankles due to supination (feet rolled inward while going down stairs). 

I like the ""stable"" look but it is for the opposite problem that I have. I'd like a wide bottom to help with stability when I walk. For this the Gaviotas look good.

Would ""professional use"" shoes, like the Bondi be ok for general standing around and walking around?  I'm looking for comfort, safety & confidence while walking. 

I would love any input or advice you could give me! TIA
",0.86,1734206328.0,5,"Bondi 8 is always a go-to for my customers who supinate. It has a wider outsole than most other Hokas and does really well at pulling the foot back to a neutral position. And, right now, it's on sale."
Recommendations,I have been debating getting a pair for so long the one thing that hinders me is the pricing. But I need a good all day shoe that supports my back as I have back problems and I can’t wear any shoe. Some shoes hurt my feet and trigger my back pain. Which ones would y’all suggest? Thanks ,0.5,1734228212.0,0,I love my Bondi SRs for standing all day. I wear Gaviotas for most pavement use and Stinsons for off trail use. You really have to try and see what works for you. Some run narrow and upsizing and/or getting wide can be an option for those but shoes are so personal. There are many perennial favorites like the Bondi and Clifton.

Bunion support?!,"Hey you guys! I (23F) have bunions & work a job where I average 14,000 steps per day. Needless to say, by the end of the day, my feet are in shambles.

So, I asked for Hokas for Christmas as I’ve heard nothing but great things about the brand in regard to support of bunions & the shoes having wider toe boxes.

My husband got me the Mach 6’s & are we trippin or do the toe boxes still look rather narrow compared to my current new balances?

It’s definitely a better a material & I know i still need to work them in. I just don’t know if maybe there were certain *types* of this brand that had the wider toe boxes & we just got a different type. Or if I’m being dramatic & just need to wait til they break in.

Let me know!😁",0.84,1734135144.0,4,The Mach 6 is a running shoe. I would NOT recommend for what you described. The Clifton or Bondi would be a better option. There is a wide version of the Mach that would have been a better choice.
Just me or..?,"Hi all,

Just curious if anyone else has had a pair of HOKAs - specifically the Bondi 8s - tear along the edge like this. 

I’ve had two pairs do this now, both within four to six months of purchase.

I never run in them but do walk an average of 7.5 miles a day, working in healthcare and walking to/from my job, so it is important my shoes are comfortable for long periods of time.

I just don’t know if this is normal or if maybe I need wide shoes? Someone I work with suggested to me it might be from the side of my foot rubbing against the shoe but I really don’t know. I’ve never really noticed if that’s the case.

Usually I would start noticing a hole develop where my big toe is at this time as well but have found patches on Amazon that seem to have completely prevented this…

Anyways, thanks for reading! Any input or advice to avoid this in the future is much appreciated. :)",0.92,1734086500.0,9,"I would guess that your suspicion that you would need wide shoes is likely correct. It’s also possible that your feet supinate heavily, which could also cause this. Four to six months is awfully short for normal wear and tear, even with that volume of walking. 

One thing you could also try is the Clifton. I have both Bondi and Clifton’s. In my Clifton’s the regular D width is fine, but I need the 2E width in my Bondis. 

I’d recommend you go to a specialty running shoe store, share your story with them, have them examine your feet, and follow their recommendation. 

I’d also consider getting two pairs and rotating them. For these shoes it really takes a full two days for the foam to reshape itself after a long distance of walking like that. Rotating will make each shoe last longer not just because you have two pairs, but also because each pair can fully recover between wears. I suggest this because the foam compression pattern on your shoes in the pic look like you’re not rotating and they’re not able to recover between days."
Low quality shoes with stingy customer service,"I got a pair of Clifton 9s. I use these as a  daily shoe; I only use them for walking. They are coming apart where the hard bottom/sole meet the mesh in 3 different places on both shoes. This happened within only a year of use/walking. I thought that Hoka made quality and durable shoes, but this seems so cheaply made with shoddy craftsmanship. I will not be purchasing Hokas ever again and will advise everyone I know to avoid them as well. Be sure to check your shoes BEFORE the one year mark as they are extremely stingy with their warranty even when they clearly made a defective product.",0.55,1734103435.0,1,"I walk around 15000 steps per day and I have to change my shoes every 6 months, no matter what brand they are.

Holy Hell!  These things are incredible!,"I've been shopping for a good shoe for a while now but I'm a bit of a cheapskate when it comes to shoes.

I bought a pair of those, I bought a pair of Nike Air Monarchs (my previous favorite) - they're all garbage now - the soles are flat and hard and offer no support.

I finally broke down when Costco had a sale on the Clifton 9's for $100 last week and I just put them on.  The very first step I took I was like ""oh WOW - these are DIFFERENT.""

Comparison: Clifton vs Bondi ,"Hi everyone! I’m back. So, as some of you may remember, I had concerns with the Clifton 9s in terms of size. I sized down a 1/2 size for a 7 in Clifton 9s and they’re perfect. The sole is springy, foot placement feels right, I can run hurdles, jog, sprint, do multiple set of A Skips, B Skips and C Skips and am movin’ and groovin’! Love the Clifton 9s that I’ve had for about a month now.

I found a deal for the Bondi 8s, and bought a pair. I had to go with my normal size with these 7.5 women. First impression: much firmer than the Clifton 9s, heavier, lots of cushion on the outer edge which feels strange. The outer sole cushion almost makes it feel like it’s trapping my foot to prevent it from rolling outward. I don’t have problems with rolling my feet, so I would say this is a feature I’m not particularly fond of. I able to bounce and hop in these, and job, but it’s not as comfortable. Definitely a firmer landing. The Clifton 9 design almost encourages your foot to rock forward, like it’s preparing you to just go. The Bondi feels a bit more flat, not feeling the rock.

They’re both great, but I imagine the Bondi pair I just purchased will be my first and last.  I am thoroughly enjoying the Clifton much better!

Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts! 💚

From what i know There are 2 things to measure the width for the fore foot of the shoes in general. The toe cap area which is a taper (where the forefoot starts to narrowing to the very end of your shoes which is when your toes started) and your forefoot width below your toe.

Usually a wide effects more on the forefoot widest area   but the tapering to the toecaps doesnt felt like changed that much on alot of shoes from what i know unless you upsized. Also i saw people said hoka's wide aren't that wide.

I can't ever use nikes shoes due to the same reason their tapers are aggresive. Nike's toe cap from what i saw is on 75mm -77mm range.

As a comparison. I dont remember exact numbers. But ultraboost 5 has like around 110mm ish forefoot area but the end of the toecaps are like 82mm ish. Or 880 v 14 which has 98-100 mm ish on the forefoot but the toecaps is around 80ish. You could check the stats yourself from runrepeat."

Best one for standing ~8 hours a day on hard surface? Looking at Bondi 8,"Trying to get a couple of pairs as gifts and for myself. Brother stands almost \~8 hours a day on a hard surface. He said his heel has shooting pain recently (I believe it's Plantar fasciitis as he said it's the worst in the morning). We've always worn Adidas Ultraboost 1.0 and NMDs before we came across Hoka and ON.

**Does anyone have any insight on the Bondi 8 or any other model that might help the most?**  
**There's not a lot of walking involved, usually standing in place.**

\-Should I be looking for a low heel to toe drop?  
\-Too much cushioning could make the Plantar fasciitis worse right?

Thanks in advance!",1.0,1732842267.0,2,"Cushion that is too soft can make PF worse but too much cushion alone isn’t bad. The Bondi 8 is a great option because it has a lot of cushion, but it’s not super squishy soft cushion. The Gaviota 5 is a good option as well as it has the same amount of cushion as the Bondi, but it fits wider. The On Cloud Monster is a good option, but doesn’t have as much arch support as the Bondi. Putting an insert in shoes can also help with PF, since it fully supports your entire foot and lets the plantar fascia tissue rest. Superfeet makes great inserts. The Bondi 8 might be hard to find in certain colors and sizes at the moment because it’s on sale due to the updated version (Bondi 9) coming out in January. 
The toe drop issue varies from person to person. The Hokas are mostly 5mm drop which is right in the middle and works for a lot of people."

Clifton 9 directly responsible for knee pain. Anyone else?,"I am fairly active and in decent shape, but I bought a pair of these for comfortable walking for a recent European vacation.  Instead of comfort, they've caused sharp knee pain in both knees that has lasted for weeks and I've had to resort to very expensive peptide therapy in attempt to heal the damage caused.  I'm surprised nobody has filed a class action lawsuit because this product is a complete joke and produced the exact opposite result of its marketing claims.  Wondering if anyone else has had these experience. It's definitely the shoes",0.3,1732586162.0,0,No issues. They have a relatively standard drop and are moderately cushioned. I would rec that you see a PT to ensure that there aren’t other issues going on as well as your experience in the shoes. Typically knee pain can be triggered by a number of factors.
Which Hoka’s have the most/best arch support?,"I’ve always worn Brooks ghost for their arch support but their recent models have gone with really soft mid soles and the find that the arch and forefoot are collapsing not providing support.

How do the Hokas compare? A store 45 min near me has the Bondi , Clifton and Ahari in my size. Wondering if it’s worth the drive ",1.0,1732554846.0,1,"I have flat feet and posterior tibial tendonitis from overpronating. Here's my take:

The Arahi and Graviota both have good arch support and excellent stability, but not a ton of cushion or drop—especially the Arahi. But they do provide really good support, especially when combined with custom or otherwise supportive insoles, and very good stability—again, especially the Arahi. It's like your foot is glued into a particular angle, you can't roll it in if you try.

The Bondi does not have that stability, but it has a ton of cushion and maybe even better arch support. It's got more drop, and a lot of ""rocker"" so that you can walk very efficiently with very little movement of your foot.

So I have all three at the moment and kind of mix them up to get my feet some exercise while always having support. Generally the Bondi is what I find I can walk the farthest in before my feet get tired and my ankles get sore. But if I were going to run, I would actually want the stability of the Arahi, even though it has less cushion, because it feels like the best at preventing a bad step from causing a strain or sprain. The Graviota falls somewhere in between, and I haven't tried the Clifton."
Clifton L or Clifton 9 for lots of city walking ,"I’m headed overseas next month and will be doing a ton of walking. I’ve never invested in good walking shoes and always end up paying the price within the first couple days of my trip. I’m ready to invest in something specifically for walking, but am struggling with what to get. The Clifton 9’s clearly have great reviews and seem pretty reliable. The Clifton L’s have significantly less reviews than the 9’s and the rating is a bit lower, but it seems like the reasoning for that lower rating might be people struggling with sizing. I find the L’s to be a much more attractive shoe than the 9’s, but if the 9’s are genuinely a better shoe, then I’m willing to make that sacrifice.

My impression of Hoka Bondi 8 with ankle arthritis.,"I bought this pair of shoes for a family member. I did some research on how to choose shoes for ankle arthritis, focusing on features like cushioning, soles, stability, and whether the person has flat feet.   
  
Some shoes are designed specifically for stability, but since my family member doesn’t have flat feet, the Bondi seemed like the closest option for purchase.

But It turns out this pair of Hoka Bondi 8 is a very stiff shoes as they use stiff foams and materials all over the shoes. For ankle arthritis or osteoarthritis, the stiff collar makes ankle swelling worse compared to soft-collar shoes. This makes the shoes even more painful after walking a shorter-than-normal distance. The Bondi shoes are so stiff in the collar, they feel like a shackle, to the point of being unbearable.

I suspect the factories making the Bondi have been using very cheap foams for a long time. The total materials cost is very possibly less than $10 per shoe. This is the reason in some regions a pair of Bondi can be sold as low as $30. If you are picking a pair of shoes to deal with ankle arthritis, then pick one with a soft collar. And Bondi failed hard to do so. 

I would also like to hear if anyone here has experience with both the Bondi and ankle arthritis. In my opinion, the Bondi is an absolutely terrible pair of shoes because of how stiff it is on the ankle. ",1.0,1731774881.0,1,"I can’t speak to ankle arthritis, but the idea that anything about this shoe is cheap is laughable. I’m a sneaker collector, I know shoes really well, and the bondi 8 is right up there with any other high quality running shoe.

You have a very specific issue to account for, but also a maximalist running shoe is a very specific product for a very specific buyer."

I have done a deep cleaning of them only once which included a full wash and air dry. I want to make sure I do not damage the foam padding. Thanks!",1.0,1731433767.0,3,I wash mine probably every 2 months or so.  I have Clifton 9s and white Bondi 8s. I pull the insole out. Spray any spots on the shoes (and I've used a toothbrush to scrub at stubborn spots) and then toss in the washing machine with detergent. I let them air dry for 2 days before I put the insoles back in and I have not had any problems. I've owned them for 18 months.

Running beginner ,"I’m kinda beginner, have chronic ankle and knee pain looking for recommendations for the best shoes for me for running and also could be used as daily life style shoes?",1.0,1731357565.0,2,"If possible, get a referral from your doc for a podiatrist and figure out what the root causes for your knee and ankle pain. Some may be mitigated by good orthotics. Also get a gait analysis from a running store. 

Most people I know with ankle and knee pain, me included, need either a stability shoe or an orthotic to provide greater stability. A lot of knee pain also comes from foot/ankle instability. 

Also…recommend not walking in your running shoes or running in your walkers. They wear out the shoe differently and can lead to imbalances and instability.

Office Flats Question,"Hey everyone! I recently changed employers, and my new office does not allow sneakers / tennis shoes worn (it's more formal than my last place of employment).

Split between SpeedGoat and Mafate Speed 4,"My first pair. Been on ASICS for years. 

I play tennis so want to separate the regular running ones from the tennis ones.

What I'm looking for:

"Rincon 2's worn out, what next?","My first Hokas are a pair of Rincon 2's that I **LOVE**. Mostly worn walking, some running, even a little hiking because they're so comfy (but mostly I wear my 2nd pair of Hokas for that, Anacapa boots).

My Rincon's are almost completely done for. I want something that feels similar but perhaps more durable, sole-wise. Sounds like the current Rincon 4 is very different from what I had. I will probably mainly walk in these but I am also considering getting back into running, so I don't want a walking-specific shoe.

Anyway, I've been meaning to get a new pair because I feel like they don't work as well as they worked as a beginner runner when my runs were around 3k, and I'm not sure whether to get the Arahi 6 or Clifton 9.

Bondi 8 soles sticking out into side of the foot? ,"Recently bought some bondi 8 wide fits, in which the soles come up the side of the shoe very slightly. 

the right shoe fits like a glove but with the left shoe as I’m running it almost feels like I’m stepping on the sole that comes up slightly on the right hand side. It’s even more noticeable when I walk. Is this a common issue and if so does it lessen with plenty of use. It’s not a massive issue but for a £150 shoe it is a bit irritating.

If it is, I would suggest you look in to Dr Scholls tri-comfort inserts (they make both men's and women's).  They're like $12. They have a solid plastic arch support that seems to completely counteract the arch issues."

Best shoe for everyday wear and walks-Hoka vs ON,Hi I'm looking to invest in a good walking shoe.

Shoe Model Advice,"Since 2020 I have been ordering the Bondi model. It has a lot of cushion which has made it so I can run with a bad back (two bulged discs). The problem I've had with them is that they start to hurt the side of my feet. The pain is around the end of the 5th metatarsals on the skin and is due to the development of corns on the skin. I went with 2E shoes and that seemed to help, but still caused some pain to my corns. However, on the last two pairs I've gotten, I've tried 4E and have no problems whatsoever. 

Here's the issue I have. 4Es are hard to come by at a brick-and-mortar store, and I just won a pair of Hokas from my local outdoor store. I know for sure they do not have 4E Bondi and are unlikely to order them. My question for the group is can I do anything with a 2E that will make it so it doesn't hurt the side of my foot? Also, are there any other Hokas that offer the same amount of cushion as the Bondi but are more accommodating to wider feet without having to get the 4E?

Got about half a thumb between my biggest toe and top of the shoe. Anyone share their views/experience? I’ve never felt happy with fitting from a shop so didn’t go down this route this time. ",1.0,1727873884.0,1,"When you say ""normal shoe size"" do you mean your running shoes, or your everyday shiny leather or whatever shoes?

I have the Mach X in a UK size 11. but my feet are a 10.5 in normal everyday shoes.

I find that with Hoka's that i definitely need a size 11.    My first pair was a 10.5 in the speedgoat 5 and they were ok, but too snug in the toebox.    all my other pairs of Hokas (several different ones) since then have been 11's.

With running shoes, you want to be a half size up minimum or even a full size as your feet swell when running.

Most of my hokas with the exception of the Clifton 9 feel very snug around the top of the foot.  This is probably because the clifton is quite padded in the upper.

i have plenty of wiggle room in the toe box of all my hoka's.   you want a sng secure fit, but if you can't wiggle your toes around freely and feel individual space (i.e. they are not squashed together),  for me i would say the are too small."

Looking for best Running Shoes for wide feet (Extra Wide?),"
Hello everyone! Kind of a beginner here. 
I currently own Nike Pegasus in 10.5 “Extra Wide”.
So far this is the only shoe that fit me without hurting on my runs. I am due for a replacement so I looked around online and gravitated toward Hokas.

Ended up buying Hoka Clifton 9s in 10.5 “Wide” and went for a run. Mid foot was sore afterwards only after 3 miles. 

Are Nike’s “Extra Wide” Measurement 4E or 2E? Did I get a shoe that is not wide enough for my foot? Was thinking of re lacing to accommodate space but I feel that is just a temporary fix. Is this normal? Need some advice before I utilize Hoka’s return policy. 

Also any good running shoe recommendations that fit similar to Nike Pegasus 10.5 Extra Wides? 

Thanks in Advance!",1.0,1726787210.0,1,"I’m guessing for an extra wide at Hoka all I see is the boni which is labelled more as a walking shoe…? Did you try brooks already. My friend got both the beast and ghost in extra wide and he loves them. 
He just used them to walk though but hey. Why not give them a try."
Gaviota 5,"Hi all!

I’ve had my Gaviota 5’s for about 2 months now and wear them daily. I wanted the extra support because I have bad pronation. I noticed when I take my shoes off after the end of a day and sit down for a few minutes, it feels almost impossible to get up and walk because my Achilles tendon is SO TIGHT! I’m wondering if the shoes are too much support in areas I don’t need? What is your experience?

I’ve also had people recommend Bondi SR because I am a teacher and I’m on my feet all day. I just had knee surgery so I need really good shoes for work right now. Thoughts on that?",1.0,1726755741.0,2,"I had lisfranc surgery about three months ago and I was recently diagnosed with arthritis in my right toe. I tried the gaviota 5's and and they were ok except they felt a little too wide and I always felt like I was standing on a slight upward slope. I returned them and got the New Balance Fresh Foam X Trail More v3.  They have a similar cushiony feel, but somehow they just feel better on my feet. I haven't felt any knee pain since wearing them either. You may want to give them a try. New Balance's return policy isn't as forgiving as Hoka's so I recommend ordering the New Balance's and tying grocery bags over them to wear them for several hours around the house. That way you get to try them out without getting them dirty."
Hoka Clifton 9 or Hoka Transport for travel/walking?,"Taking a trip to Europe soon, not doing any hiking but will be stopping by Iceland for 2 days as part of the trip. 

I have the Clifton 8's (pretty beat up now) and I'm assuming that the 9's are fairly similar. Came across the Transport on the Dick's Sporting Goods website and it piqued my interest. Does anyone have any experience with the Hoka Transport? Been reading mixed reviews about the cushion and wanted to see how they stack up to the Clifton line. 

Thanks in advance!!",1.0,1726715134.0,3,"My first instinct is to go with the Clifton 9s. The transports come in Gore-Tex (GTX) Waterproof, so if you're planning to be in extreme weather/value waterproof shoes, those will be that. However, they really are more of an everyday casual/lifestyle shoe. They don't have as much support or cushion as the Clifton 9s and don't have as much of a Meta Rocker, so the walking movement won't be as smooth (in my opinion, at least.)"
A warning for anyone considering buying from the Hoka website ,"I ordered a pair of shoes on the 15th from the UK Hoka website and the delivery day given was the 17th. I checked the status of the order today, a day after my shoes were due, and my order is still processing. I have tried to use the live chat feature but it's not currently available. The automated response to my email to customer service says it will take 5-7 working days to get a response.

I ordered these for an event and it looks like they won't arrive on time now. I've seen other people on here and in the Hoka EU Instagram comments with similar complaints that they haven't received their orders and can't get on contact with anyone. The recent trust pilots reviews are also terrible with people not able to return products or contact anyone at the company. It's disappointing because I have not had issues in the past with Hoka but now I'm doubtful I receive anything at all.

Has anyone had any luck getting in contact with Hoka? Also if you're thinking about ordering from them in Europe I would recommend you buy though a 3rd party retailer.",0.89,1726658933.0,13,That really sucks to hear. I’m really sorry about all that. They should be updating you and it seems their customer service is lacking in the EU and UK. I’m wondering if we should sticky this post so that it doesn’t get buried.

Hoka Transport (review) - Do not recommend it,"I bought the Hoka Transport waterproof trainers to take on holidays, as I was going to be walking a lot.
Had to half size up for comfort, even though my feet are quite narrow.

Ahead of my holidays, I wore it a few times and thought it wasn’t the most comfortable pair I owned but gave it the benefit of doubt. Aesthetic, I also like the looks of it.

Two days into my holidays, 20k steps each day and I am out of action. 7 blisters in one foot, 3 blisters on another. I am in pain and disappointed. Spent my time researching for trainers which were supposed to be amazing and it has potentially made my holidays to Japan awkward. Not even sure if I am able to do the hikes I have planned.

They have minimal cusion and usually have something called 'zero drop' or 'low drop'.

Not A Runner & I Got The Arches From Hell,"So, I (52F) have never been athletic. I run if I'm being chased, and that's it. Same goes for hiking. I've also ripped ligaments in my ankles multiple times doing very basic things -- like tripping off ONE step and got grade 2 sprains in my anterior deltoid. When I had an MRI for said ripping, I found out there is arthritis in my feet as well. Ugh. 

I thought Hokas were a running/hiking shoe only, and thus of no use to me. Then my brother, sis-in-law, nephew, cousins, and several friends became Hoka converts. 95% of them are non-athletes like me. One cousin had been 'prescribed' Hokas by her orthopedist for arthritis in her feet. All of them raved about how comfy they were and now won't wear anything else. Hmm. Bought a pair of Clifton 9s from the Hoka site. Yes, they are pricey, but I'm willing to pay a little more for good quality and longevity.

Y'all. My heels feel cradled, for lack of a better word. I honestly feel like my feet are 'floating'. I was surprised how lightweight they are, given the thick soles. While they don't have actual ankle support, the width of the sole kinda stabilizes my feet. I went bonkers and bought 2 more pairs!

TL;DR: Hokas are awesome for everyday walking and aren't just for runners and hikers. 

My only complaint would be in the arch support. I have crazy high arches (pes cavus) and most shoes don't support them enough. These shoes do give more support than the usual sneaker, but I could use a little more support. Can anyone recommend an arch insert?

",1.0,1724903775.0,2,"For inserts, 'superfeet' and 'oboz' are my go-to in these situations. Oboz also makes shoes that come with their awesome inserts. They focus on arch support, sturdiness, and durability (hokas seem to lack durability), though they do tend to be a bit narrow in the toebox and they may have a short 10 ish mile break-in period. For every day use i recommend the katabatic or bozeman. Something to keep in mind if your hokas aren't cutting it. Otherwise, enjoy walking on them comfy ass clouds."
Are these at the point of replacement?,"First pair of Hoka just outside a year old, never used for running but daily pair.
Normally wear newbalance and it’s clear when those go, but I am having some discomfort and I’m not sure if it is due to the shoe or just general lifestyle.

Once a week in the summer for my bartending part time job. The shoes are literally falling apart. I have never paid over $100 for shoes and I’m regretting it now. I also picked them up from a retailer, because the ones I ordered online got delayed and were going to arrive after my trip, so the customer service rep told me returning them and/or getting refunded may be difficult. I’m just sad and frustrated! Everyone talked these shoes up so much and I’m regretting splurging. ",1.0,1724859634.0,11,Yes it’s the Hoka build quality. 👎👎👎.  Send them back.

However, due to my wide feet, my options for carbon plate shoes or other high-performance shoes are limited. Does anyone with wide feet like me have any recommendations or experience to share? I'd love to hear real-world experiences.

Last HM I ran in Mach 5s which also come in a wide fit, as does the Mach 6 that replaces them.  

For a plated shoe I think the New Balance SC Elite 4 might be ok for wider footed runners - will cost you though! I’ve heard people say the Adidas Adios Pro 3 is quite wide fitting - I haven’t tried them but this has never been my experience of Adidas shoes.

The Hoka Mach X 2, which has a Pebax plate, is due out soon too (when!?) and may have a wide version too? If it does I’ll definitely be checking it out."
Breathability of Transport GTX vs regular? ,"Hi, I want to know which is more breathable, the women’s Hoka Transport regular or GTX.

Thank you!

Which shoes are right for me?,"I’m looking to purchasing the Bondi SR but I just wanted to make sure they are right for me as they are expensive (!)

I work in retail and am on my feet all day as well as walking to and from work. All leather is preferred for the weather when I’m outside. A lot of speed-walking is also involved.

Are Hoka toe boxes narrow?,"Since I spend all day on my feet and do a lot of walking I bought a pair of Bondi 8s as per recommendations from coworkers. They were fine for months but I'm starting to encounter pain that I don't remember having when the shoes were new.

I normally wear 11.5 EEE but due to a bone spurs in my right heel (that are pulling on the Achilles) I'm up to 13 EEEE. My left foot is marginally longer than my right. The problem that I'm having at the moment is that it feels like the toes on my left foot are being smashed together as if the shoes are too narrow, rather surprising since these shoes are a bit bigger than I'm used to.

Maintaining Hokas,"I recently was gifted barely used Rincon 3 Hokas. I wore them to a long day at the zoo, and wow….. I didn’t know it wasn’t normal for your feet to ache of pain 1 hour into walking around and they eventually go kinda numb😭🙃🙃🙃 I lasted almost 3 hours before I even thought about foot pain!! I have plantar fasciitis so I need all of the support I can get, just haven’t been able to financially make it a priority the past couple of years. 

So, with such a good experience with them, I want to try to care for them so they last. I have 2 questions…. 1) I understand that they’ll loose that cushion and support eventually, so, do I buy supportive insoles now? Or wait until the shoe starts to show signs of wearing out? And 2) What is something I can do daily/weekly to help the inside of the shoes from smelling horrible and eliminate that bacteria in the shoe? I have decent moisture control socks for sweat but I just have very sweaty feet I think 🤷🏼‍♀️🥴 I’ve seen online that I could spritz the inside with a mix of rubbing alcohol and water to kill the smell causing bacteria, I’m just so worried about ruining the shoes and don’t want to accidentally be ruining the inside fabric and structure of the shoe. Do you put anything inside your shoe to freshen it or disinfect it?",0.75,1724379690.0,2,"Hoka are the worst kind of shoe for you! I’m surprised they didn’t make your feet worse. They are low drop which means they redistribute any stress to the foot. Hopefully you’ll be ok in them but if not, you may need to rethink. You’ll be better in a high drop shoe - like 10-12mm. 

Read this any you’ll understand more.

In short “In general, a shoe with a higher drop will be easier on the lower leg—foot, ankle, Achilles, calf—while directing more stress to the knees and hips,” Beverly says. “A lower-drop shoe will typically spare the knees but put more stress on the lower leg.”"

I only later found out they were fake when I noticed the box had blurry printings and Chinese characters on it. The shoe box was also placed in another parcel box that led me to a Chinese marketplace for fakes. Additionally, the inside of the shoe had no ventilation holes when I took out the padding. I was so mad. These fakes are getting out of hand. So maybe try looking inside the shoe and try to see if you could find anything odd. Because from the outside you could not tell at all unless you have a pair of real ones next to you. I have two real cliftons so I couldn’t compare it with the bondi."

Which one?,"Hi! Looking to get a pair of Hoka’s. I used the shoe finder but I’m still confused. lol. Looking for basic wear, and some daily treadmill/road walking and maybe some light running. I think my feet are pretty standard. I like Brooks Ghost. Any thoughts? ",1.0,1722386039.0,3,If you like the Brooks Ghost then you should try Hoka rincon or Clifton if you want more cushion.
Warranty policy?,"Bought my shoes off Nordstrom and have had them for almost a year. I LOVE my Clifton’s but they are peeling. I sent them to Hoka to do the credit thing and it’s been almost a week 😭 I checked my tracking but it doesn’t say anything. Even if they reject my shoes, can I get them back????
",1.0,1722386973.0,1,You had them a year and sent them back? That’s a very long time to have them!
Irritating experience with the warranty department,"I bought a pair of Anacapas on March 8th of this year. They developed a split in the sole right at the ball of the foot, so I sent them in for a warranty claim. Included a copy of my purchase receipt with the date circled so they would know it was purchased recently.

Today I received my shoes in the mail with a note from the warranty department saying that the claim was denied because the original purchase date was more than a year ago. I tried talking to customer service but they were zero help. I’m honestly considering sending them back to the warranty department with a note explaining things… but I feel like they’ll just come up with a new excuse. These shoes cost me $155 and I got less than four months of use out of them. Really frustrating. Anybody think I’d have success retrying the warranty claim? Annoying because I have to pay for shipping again.",0.75,1722370072.0,2,"Nope, i had the same problem, after 20km the sole had wear that was not acceptable contacted the support to activate the warranty on the speedgoat, but they rejected it with lots of bureaucracy, processes and excuses. the shoe lasted 100km before it went to the trash.

Hoka stop spending millions in influencers and publicity and start investing in product and customer support."
Arahi 7,"Would it be a waste of money to use this for the gym (weights)?

I would occasionally use it for running, walking, and light trails.",1.0,1722290717.0,2,Why would it be a waste? Surely you need some kind of footwear?  I usually google style and size and buy last season’s colours for a decent saving. Rarely buy direct from Hoka.
"Do you find these need to be broken in? Some reviews said no break in period needed, but my new Kaha 2 Gtx hurt like hell on my soles","My podiatrist recommended this brand for the max cushion, but I'm considering returning them and trying Brooks or ON or some other brand.",1.0,1722297033.0,1,"They are low drop and take a lot getting used to. I would alternate them with your other shoes for a month, then you should be ok. Brooks are the complete opposite and high drop. They would more likely aggravate hips/knees. You might’ve been better with a Clifton or Bondi though for cushioning. Or speedgoat (they do a mid version) if it’s more for trails."

Squeakers! Input please! Thanks in advance.,"So, I’ve had my first pair of Clifton 9’s for about a week. One thing I’ve noticed is the amount of squeaking they make (the basketball shoe kind) when I walk around. Perhaps it’s because I occasionally drag my left foot due to disability. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this with Hoka. Still enjoy these though!",0.91,1722134721.0,8,Baby powder under insoles. Work every time

Stinson 7 vs Bondi 8 ,"I first bought the Stinson 7, put 200 miles on them and decided I wanted to give the bondi 8 a try for my strictly road runs. I am experiencing new knee pain and heel pain after a few different runs .. anyone know if there is a major difference here that I could be missing ? ",1.0,1721914166.0,1,They are both great. I use my Stinson's primarily for off road and hiking. I use my Gaviotas and Bondi's for road/sidewalk use. I find that I prefer the Gaviotas to the Bodi 8 since they are a bit wider. I have yet to try an Bondi 8 in wide although I don't have a wide foot. The Gaviota and the Stinson both share the same H-frame compared to the J-frame of the Bondi. I like the more stable ride. I also exclusively wear the Bondi SR for work and standing all day. They seem to have been built off the Bondi 7 with a different non-slip sole.
