## 🧠 Project Overview

Public sentiment significantly impacts a brand’s reputation, market value, and customer trust. Yet, many brands lack the tools to analyze real-time feedback shared by users on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. This project presents a robust NLP pipeline to **monitor, classify, and visualize sentiment trends** for brands using social media data.

We leverage both traditional models and state-of-the-art transformer-based deep learning architectures to understand nuanced, context-aware sentiment and provide actionable insights to brands for product and communication strategy.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Collect and preprocess large-scale datasets from Twitter and Reddit.
- Apply lexicon-based, clustering, and transformer models for sentiment classification.
- Compare model performance (accuracy, interpretability, efficiency).
- Use LLMs (BERT, Gemini) to:
  - Detect mixed or ambiguous sentiment.
  - Extract contextual sentiment cues.
  - Summarize trends and topic clusters.
- Visualize sentiment trends over time with interactive dashboards.
- Provide actionable insights to enhance brand strategy and engagement.

## 🗃️ Dataset Details

The Reddit dataset was collected using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and includes:

- `Subreddit`: Community where the post originated.
- `Timestamp`: Post creation date and time.
- `Title` and `Body`: Main textual content.
- `First Comment`: Top user comment on the post.
- `Upvotes` and `Upvote Ratio`: Measures of community approval.
- `Number of Comments`: Engagement metric.

Two domains were analyzed:
- **Athletic Apparel Brands**
- **Technology Companies**

## 🧹 Preprocessing Pipeline

### 🔤 Text Clean-Up
- Lowercased text
- Removed punctuation, special characters, numbers
- Removed stopwords (using NLTK)

### 🧠 NLP Tasks
- Tokenization  
- Lemmatization  
- POS tagging  
- Emoji normalization (using `emoji` package)

### 🤖 Transformer Input Processing
- BERT subword tokenization
- Attention masks and padding
- Uniform input formatting for deep models

---

## 🧪 Models Used

### 🔹 Lexicon-Based
- **VADER**: Lightweight rule-based model for polarity scoring

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means**: Clustered sentiment-rich post vectors (TF-IDF) to create pseudo-labels

### 🔹 Transformer-Based Deep Learning
- **BERT (`bert-base-uncased`)**
  - Context-aware embedding
  - Fine-tuned on pseudo-labeled Reddit data
  - Achieved 85–90% accuracy

- **Gemini**
  - Efficient transformer architecture (used in place of LLaMA)
  - Fine-tuned with mixed precision & gradient checkpointing
  - Lower memory footprint, good for deployment

## ✅ Results

| Model   | Type       | Accuracy | Notes |
|---------|------------|----------|-------|
| VADER   | Rule-based | –        | Used for pseudo-labels |
| K-Means | Clustering | –        | Unsupervised label generation |
| BERT    | Transformer| 85–90%   | Best performance, handles context and sarcasm |
| Gemini  | Transformer| ~80–85%  | Lightweight alternative to BERT |

- **Visualizations**: Sentiment trends, confusion matrices, accuracy/loss curves.
- **Findings**:
  - Neutral sentiment dominated across both domains.
  - Positive sentiment reflected strong brand loyalty.
  - Sarcasm and ambiguity remained challenges.
